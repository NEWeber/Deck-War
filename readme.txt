WAR
by Nicholas Weber
v 0.1
deck.html is a simple JavaScript implementation of the card game War.

Planned improvements:
- Make Aces high, not low.
- Have a tie resolution system so that the next card is drawn and compared to resolve ties.
- Shuffle the deck and draw from the top, not take a random card from the deck.
- Have a persistent state of the game until one side wins or loses (arguably, this would not be an improvement).
