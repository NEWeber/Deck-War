WAR
by Nicholas Weber
v 0.2
deck.html is a simple JavaScript implementation of the card game War.

Improvements over last version:

- Made Aces high, not low.
- Implemented a tie resolution system so that the next card is drawn and compared to resolve ties.

Planned improvements:
- Integrate functions into the objects better.
- Shuffle the deck and draw from the top, not take a random card from the deck.
- Have a persistent state of the game until one side wins or loses (arguably, this would not be an improvement).
